# Research Experiences
## *Ongoing research projects*
### [1] Evaluating the visual accessibility of urban greenspaces from different building heights on a global scale 
* Develop an efficient method to calculate the green view index (GVI) of different building heights.
* Evaluate the visual accessibility of urban greenspaces across different cities worldwide.

### [2] Generating a worldwide high spatial resolution hourly land surface temperature product
* Develop a high spatial resolution, hourly LST data generation framework using ECOSTRESS LST data, as well as multi-source data.
* Apply the framework globally to generate a valid product.

## *Several previous projects*
### [3] Research on Segment Anything Model (SAM)-Assisted remote sensing crop mapping
#### *Enhancing crop mapping through an automated sample generation framework based on SAM*
* Evaluate the performance of SAM for crop parcel segmentation using medium-resolution satellite imagery, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8.
* Develop a novel automated sample generation framework based on SAM.
* Assess the effectiveness of the framework in Henan Province of China and southern Ontario of Canada.
* Relevant code can be found at [SAM-CropSampleGeneration](https://github.com/Nick0317Sun/SAM-CropSampleGeneration). Related publication: [Sun et al., 2024](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/9/1505).

#### *A weakly supervised learning method based on SAM for crop mapping*
* Use adapters to finetune SAM for crop parcel segmentation in Sentinel-2 images.
* Generate high-quality pseudo labels through finetuned SAM and weak annotations, replacing the labor-intensive process of obtaining pixel-level annotations.
* Apply pseudo labels to train a fully supervised segmentation model to conduct crop mapping.
* Relevant code can be found at [SAMWS](https://github.com/Nick0317Sun/SAMWS). Related publication: [Sun et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569843224004394).

### [4] Large-scale crop mapping with multi-source satellite images using a spatiotemporal datacube-based deep learning framework
* Develop a datacube-based framework to conduct large-scale crop mapping.
* Adopt a novel sample extraction technique based on spatiotemporal datacube.
* Fuse GF-1 and Sentinel-2 multi-temporal images by early and late fusion strategies.
