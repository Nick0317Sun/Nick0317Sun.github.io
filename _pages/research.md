# Research Experiences
## *Ongoing research projects*
### [1] Evaluating the visual accessibility of urban greenspaces from different building heights on a global scale 
* Develop an efficient method to calculate the green view index (GVI) of different building heights.
* Evaluate the visual accessibility of urban greenspaces across different cities worldwide.

### [2] Generating a worldwide high spatial resolution hourly land surface temperature product
* Develop a high spatial resolution, hourly LST data generation framework using ECOSTRESS LST data, as well as multi-source data.
* Apply the framework globally to generate a valid product.

## *Previous projects*
### [3] Research on Segment Anything Model (SAM)-Assisted remote sensing crop mapping
#### *Enhancing crop mapping through an automated sample generation framework based on SAM*
* Evaluate the performance of SAM for crop parcel segmentation using medium-resolution satellite imagery, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8.
