I am a master student in Land use and information technology at China Agricultural
University. My research now is mainly focused on using **satellite imagery** with
**machine learning (ML)** and **artificial intelligence (AI)** to monitor crop distribution
information over a large scale.

Recently I am interested in what foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM)
can bring to remote sensing and agriculture. Therefore, I am working on a project that
involves evaluating the performance of SAM and some practical applications.

Because of my passion for remote sensing and AI technology, I plan to pursue
a related phd degree and continue to engage in related research.
