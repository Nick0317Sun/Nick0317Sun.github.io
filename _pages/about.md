I received my master's degree in Land Use and Information Technology from China Agricultural University. Currently, I am working as a research assistant for [Prof. Xuecao Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=r2p47SEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) in China Agricultural University. My research now is mainly 
focused on the impact of green space on different building heights, as well as the generation of high spatial resolution hourly land surface temperature products. More details about me can be found in the attached personal CV.
